# 29/04/2024 - Translate Right Shift

## The Problem

**Imagine the users on your app are all typing slightly incorrectly, in that they shifted their hands one key to the right. Write a function that translates what they mean to say.** The examples below assume an ANSI keyboard layout, you can choose how you want to do that!

Example:

```
> translateRightShift(';p; epeor')
"lol wowie"

> translateRightShift('ejp s, o')
"who am i"
```
